# Installation

To set up this Chrome extension locally, first clone this repo locally. Then run `npm i` to build all necessary dependencies and then `npm run build` to build the extension. Next, go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and click "Load unpacked" in the top left corner. From the popup file explorer navigate to the `build` folder that was previously generated and select that folder. After that, you should see the extension as one of you extensions. You can then launch the extension by clicking on the icon for it in the Extensions icon in the top right corner.
